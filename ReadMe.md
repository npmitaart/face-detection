# Face Detection Implementation
###### In this mini project, the theory that will be used is Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers. The method was proposed by P. Viola and M. Jones in 2001. In simple explanation, Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers is a machine learning method where it trained on a large amount of positive and negative image, that will be used to detecting object.
